Functional, bytecode interpreted language written in C

## Credits
Lots of the interpreter's frontend code and general semantics are inspired by [Clox (from Crafting Interpreters)](https://www.github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/c), so huge thanks to [Bob Nystrom](https://www.github.com/munificent) for his awesome book.
